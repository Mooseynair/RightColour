# Right Colour

---

Created a program to beat the game Right Colour. In the game Right Colour you must match coloured tiles with the colour of the prompt. With each match you gain a point and the colour of the prompt changes. If they don’t match simply swipe the tile to the side to bring up  a new tile and continue trying to match the prompt and the tile.

Here’s a dandy lil image to show you what the game looks like:

# How to work the program

---

Begin a game and intentionally lose to bring up the retry button. From here you can run the code by typing in the terminal:

```bash
python RightColour.py
```

The script will run and the program will start swiping to match/skip tiles

To terminate the program simply hold down the letter “Q” key on your keyboard.
